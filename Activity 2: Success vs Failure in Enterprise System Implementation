c. case study 2: Failed Enterprise System Implementation
   c.1. company overview (Reason for implementing the enterprise system)
            COMPANY: Nike
            Reason for implementing: Nike implemented its ERP system upgrade in 2000 to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and support its global expansion.
                                    The $400 million investment was aimed at integrating various business functions such as supply chain, inventory management, and finance, enabling better decision-making, real-time data insights, and more effective management of Nike’s complex global operations.
                                    This system was crucial for Nike to maintain its competitive edge and respond quickly to market demands.
   c.2. implementation process & challenges
            Implementation Process: The process likely involved selecting and customizing the new system, integrating various business functions like inventory, supply chain, and finance, and rolling it out across their operations.
            Challenges: Nike's challenges on implementing their ERP system are the following; 
                        1. Overly Unrealistic Goals: Nike sets unrealistic goals without fully considering the complexities of their business operations and global ooperations.
                        2. Lack of proper testing: Deploying the system without making sure it complied with operational requirements resulted in problems completing consumer orders, particularly for popular items like Air Jordans.
                        3. Integration Issues:  The new system failed to properly integrate with existing business functions, causing delays in inventory management and order fulfillment.
                        4. Operational Impact: These difficulties resulted in a 20% decline in stock price and a $100 million loss in revenue, highlighting the serious consequences of an unsuccessful ERP deployment.
c.3. Key failure factors
            - The key failure factors of Nike's enterprise system implementation are their overly unrealistic goals, lack of proper testing and considerations for meeting the operational requirments, integration issues and the operational impacts.
c.4. outcomes & consequences
            - These difficulties resulted in a 20% decline in stock price and a $100 million loss in revenue, highlighting the serious consequences of an unsuccessful ERP deployment.
